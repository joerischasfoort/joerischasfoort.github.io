I am a lecturer at the Faculty of Economics and Business from the University of Groningen. My [research](https://joerischasfoort.github.io/) is primarily focused on using agent-based computational models to study financial stability and the Covid-19 pandemic. I defended my dissertation titled “Agent-Based Simulations of Monetary Policy and Financial Markets” at the University of Groningen on the 11th of June 2020. Below, you will find a brief overview of my teaching experience. I have also included a links to my social media, full academic CV and contact details.

## Teaching
In 2018, I was awarded the Dutch University Teacher Qualifications degree by the University of Groningen. This degree demonstrates a proven ability to both develop and teach university level courses and is recognized by all other Dutch universities.
Starting before that, I have been actively involved in the development of several online courses on the Coursera and Futurelearn platform. Furthermore, I have helped design and taught several years for the following two courses.
1. [Decision making in a complex and uncertain world](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/complexity-and-uncertainty), an online course for University of Groningen.
2. [Global Finance & Growth](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/feb/vak/show?code=EBM150A05), a master course at University of Groningen.

title: Why asset price volatility increases wealth inequality
---

This blog post will cover [my paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3452599) which explains why an increase in asset price volatility will lead to an increase in wealth inequality.

Wealth inequality, and inequality in general, have recently come to the forefront
of economics ([Pikkety 2015](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151060), [Saez & Zucman 2016](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/519/2607097)). When it comes to the role of the stock market in generating wealth inequality, [Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180158) find that stock return heterogeneity increased equity wealth inequality in Indian stock markets. They assert that if some undiversified investors randomly do well, while others randomly do poorly, this would generate inequality on its own.

In my paper, I build on that assertion and as ask how stock price volatility is related to wealth inequality. It is well known that stock price volatility magnifies trading returns and losses. Following the logic of [Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180158), if stock price volatility increases log heterogeneous returns, this should, in turn, increase wealth inequality.

Testing this assumption is problematic because it requires data on individual wealth inequality from those individuals that participate in the stock market. This type of data is typically not available. Furthermore, one would like to operate in a controlled setting where the effect of volatility on inequality can be isolated.

To do the latter, I turn to simulation modelling. The type of model I employ is an agent-based model because in these types of models individual data can be tracked. My model consists of a hundred noise traders that hold a portfolio that contains stocks and money. Each agent forms expectations about the future stock price based on white noise. This means that every simulation period agents will randomly expect the price to move up or down. When they expect that the price will go up the next period, they buy now. Agents that expect the price to go down will try to sell stocks.

This means that in the simulation, there is supply and demand. How will these be matched? For this, I use a limit-order book matching algorithm that is very similar to those employed by real stock markets. The algorithm tries to match buy orders with the highest price to sell orders with the lowest price, as long as the price of the buy order is higher or equal to that of the sell order. When two orders are matched, a transaction will take place between the owners of these orders.

I simulate this model using Monte Carlo methods in which the model is simulated multiple times with different random seeds. Using this technique, the following data is generated.

What does this picture depict? Let's start with the left-top picture. This panel shows the Monte Carlo average stock price that is generated by the interactions of the agents. The dotted lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals. The top-right picture shows, in bars, the average volume traded every period.

The two bottom panels depict the evolution of inequality over the course of the simulations. The leftmost panel depict the evolution of the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of inequality. It can take values between 0 and 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. The rightmost bottom panel depicts that dynamics of the Palma coefficient. The Palma ratio measures the ratio of the richest 10% of the agentâ€™s share of wealth over the share of the poorest 40% of the agents. Both measures increases over time. However, it is not clear what causes this.

To find out if it is caused by volatility, a simulation experiment is needed. Luckily the ABM is perfect for this because it allows us to vary volatility while leaving all other properties the same. However, this being an ABM, we cannot change price volatility directly because the trading between the autonomous agents will generate the price and its volatility. That being said, in this particular model with noise traders, the parameter which regulates the intensity of noisy expectations will directly impact price volatility. When traders have more noise expectations, they will create more noisy prices.

In this simulation experiment, I will increase the noise parameter from 0.05 to 0.5 in steps of 0.05. To make sure that randomness does not affect our results, I will simulate 10 Monte Carlo simulations for every step. This means, there will be 9 * 10 = 90 simulations in total. At the end of every simulation, I measure the Gini and Palma coefficient.

So, what happens if we plot the volatility of expectations against the Monte Carlo average price volatility, heterogeneity of returns and (end of simulation) Gini and Palma? Let's see:

![experiment](/images/experiment.png){:class="img-responsive"}

There is a lot to unpack here. Let's start with the top-left panel. The picture shows that, as the volatility of expectations increases (X-axis), the average volatility of the price (Y-axis) increases. The confidence interval bands are not too wide, showing that this effect is reliable. This confirms that the parameter we chose for our experiment was correct.

Next, we move to the second part of the transmission channel: heterogeneity of log returns. I measure heterogeneity in log returns as the standard deviation of individual log returns. The top-right picture shows that increasing volatility of expectations indeed increases the heterogeneity of log returns, as expected.

Finally, we move to the final part of the channel: inequality. We have seen that indeed increasing the volatility of expectations, increases price volatility and the heterogeneity of log returns. The bottom two panels confirm that it also increases inequality. Both the general measure of inequality (Gini coefficient, bottom-left panel) and the measure of inequality at the extremes (Palma ratio, bottom-right panel) increase as volatility increases.

Therefore, the experiment does not contradict our hypothesis. Increasing volatility seems to increase heterogeneous log returns and wealth inequality. This is the main result of the paper.  

But, how do we know that this result is not a consequence of the specific model parameters that I have chosen. What happens if other parameters were chosen for sample size, risk aversion, the spread of the agents, and horizon they use? Does price volatility still increase inequality under different parameter variations?

The answer to this question can be obtained by doing a what is known as a *global sensitivity analysis.* In such an analysis, parameters are first varied, yielding several parameter combinations. Then, for each combination, Monte Carlo simulations are performed and the results on inequality (Gini) are recorded.

To make sense of this data, I use a technique known as Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test or **eFast**. Running eFast over the results produces two measures. The total and direct effects changes of parameters have on the Gini coefficient. The following picture shows the results:

![experiment](/images/robustness.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The picture clearly shows that the volatility parameter has the biggest effect on inequality. Even though all of these parameters where varied. This means that the results of the simulations are robust.


This work is novel because most research has focused on a channel that works through stock price levels. Following this channel, when stock prices rise, inequality increases because it is mostly the rich that own stocks and vice versa.

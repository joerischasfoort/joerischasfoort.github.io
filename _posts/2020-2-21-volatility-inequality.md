title: Why asset price volatility increases wealth inequality
---

This blog post will cover [my paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3452599) which explains why an increase in asset price volatility will lead to an increase in wealth inequality.

Wealth inequality, and inequality in general, have recently come to the forefront
of economics ([Pikkety 2015](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151060), [Saez & Zucman 2016](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/519/2607097)). When it comes to the role of the stock market in generating wealth inequality, [Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180158) find that stock return heterogeneity increased equity wealth inequality in Indian stock markets. They assert that if some undiversified investors randomly do well, while others randomly do poorly, this would generate inequality on its own.

In my paper, I build on that assertion and as ask how stock price volatility is related to wealth inequality. It is well known that stock price volatility magnifies trading returns and losses. Following the logic of [Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180158), stock price volatility should increase log heterogeneous returns which, in turn, should increase wealth inequality.

I test that hypothesis by constructing a simple agent-based simulation model. The model consists of a hundred noise traders that hold a portfolio that contains stocks and money. Each agent forms expectations based on a noise component.

My main result is that increasing volatility will increase wealth inequality at the end of the simulation.

This result is robust to a sensitivity analysis. 

This work is novel because most research has focused on a channel that works through stock price levels. Following this channel, when stock prices rise, inequality increases because it is mostly the rich that own stocks and vice versa.

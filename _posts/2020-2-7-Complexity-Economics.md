*This post is based on a piece written for Exploring Economics*

In this blogpost, I will explore a fairly recent school of economic thought: complexity economics.

Complexity economics is the study of economic systems as complex systems. Complex
systems are systems which consist of interacting individuals that change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create (Arthur 2013). Complexity economists study the emergence of structures and the unfolding of patterns in the economy (Arthur 1999).Since the 2008 financial crisis, when mainstream equilibrium models had little to add in terms of policy direction (Armstrong 2017), there has been increasing interest in using ideas from complexity theory (Battiston et al 2016).
